# Resume
Welcome to my resume repo! My name is Lucas Carneiro and I am excited to embark on the journey to become a software engineer. The goal of this repo is to both allow me to work on my resume remotely and publish it on my home server, and to showcase some of the coding skills and experience I have gained along the way since I finished my PhD.
