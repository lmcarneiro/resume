# About Me
Hey there, welcome to my personal resume repository! My name is Lucas Carneiro and I've always been passionate about science and technology. During my PhD in Physical Chemistry, I learned how to use Python in order to work with our data and that's when I found out how much I love coding. This repository is a space where I can showcase my technical skills and experience, and also make my resume accessible from anywhere. I've been working on a few coding projects over the past couple of years, and I'm excited to share them with potential employers. My ultimate goal is to land a fulfilling job in the tech industry where I can apply my analytical skills and programming abilities to make a positive impact. Thank you for taking the time to check out my repository, and please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or opportunities to collaborate.
